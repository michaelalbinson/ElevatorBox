# ElevatorBox
The code, schematic and instructions for the elevator failure counting box I made for work. 'Twas good fun.

## Usage
To use the counter box for the first time:
1. Plug it in
2. Wait for it to complete it's introduction
3. The numbers should be flashing, this means you can set the current day count by using the four buttons on the side of the box (+1 +10 -1 -10)
4. When the number is correct press the red button on the top of the box
5. it should beep and begin the count

To reset:
1. press the red button on the top of the box
2. it should beep and show the phrase "ELEVATOR FAILURE"
3. the lights should begin flashing and you can follow the steps above to reset the number as desired *OR* to simply restart the count just press the top red button again
